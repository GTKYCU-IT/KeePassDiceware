A [KeePass Password Safe](https://keepass.info/) plugin that provides a custom, configurable password generator implementation that generates [diceware](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) style [passwords](https://xkcd.com/936/).

## üî∞ Project State
This plugin exists because I wanted it for my personal use. I'm sharing it in the hopes someone else out there finds it useful, too. There's bound to be tons of rough edges, bugs, or other issues. Feel free to open an issue or PR if you find anything.

## üí° Inspiration
I decided to write this because there wasn't anything quite like it. I'm a big fan of [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/), an iOS and macOS password safe compatable with the KeePass database format. The password generator built into Strongbox offers a diceware method. I decided to replicate it's behavior here, and even offer the same wordlists! The Strongbox source (AGPL-3.0) is available [here](https://github.com/strongbox-password-safe/Strongbox).
